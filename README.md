d34raphael
==========

d3 support for raphael. This means it supports IE!

*This project is in maintenance mode* -- it tracks *d3v2* and uses a single-package,
brute-force way of injecting Raphael support into d3. That said, it's
battle-tested, and tested and used in-production at [Socrata](https://github.com/socrata).
It works fully on IE8+.

If you are looking for a more modern approach, take a look at [r2d3](https://github.com/mhemesath/r2d3/).
